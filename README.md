# Fundamentals-of-gas-turbines-Bathie
This project was based on the book Fundamentals of gas turbines made by William W. Bathie.
This project was the the first Python program I made so it has a very novice way of programming.

All the files are written in my native lenguage (Spanish) and some Spanglish too haha!.

I'm no longer working on this, I've made this repository to help other students and teachers with the hard examples that are in this book, if you're interested in something give a comment or contact me in my email.

Luck!
